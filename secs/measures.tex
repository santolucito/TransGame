\subsection{Target Audience}
There are an estimated 1.4 million families with a transgender member in the United States~\cite{howmanytrans}. With a average family size of 3.14~\cite{}, there are 4,396,000 close families members directly affect by transgender issues, only in the United States. The number grows exponentially when we consider extended family, friends, coworkers of these people, as well as the global scale of transgender issues. 

\subsection{Measuring social impact} 
The key performance indicator at a social level is the self reports after using the product that families are experiencing strengthened relationships.

\subsection{Measuring business success}
The key business performance indicator is number of patient downloads, which will directly correspond to revenue.
The number of practitioners distributing the app (provider downloads) is another indicator of lasting business strength.
