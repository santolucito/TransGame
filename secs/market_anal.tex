\textbf{Project Evo} has raised \$42 million in venture funding and is now seeking FDA approval of a game as ADHD treatment. They are also developing tools for Autism, depression, Alzheimer’s disease, and traumatic brain injury~\cite{akili}.

While these games are broadening the standard of care for important psychiatric conditions, they are primarily focused on {\it games played directly by patients}. We intend to further this already proven model by expanding it to include a wider social environment. As mental health is critically affected by the social interactions between people and their environment, we believe that it is not possible to ignore this effect when attempting to treat mental health problems, especially those which are socially stigmatized.


However, they are not a true competitor since they are not targeting social issues. The market for games as psychiatric treatment remains open, but we compete with pharmaceuticals and in-person therapy. We are proposing an alternative (or supplement) to such traditional treatments.

HopeLabs \url{http://www.hopelab.org/about/} is a nonprofit using technology for health. They build a game to help kids understand cancer treatment, as well as an autotexter that send nice messages to kids that encouraged them to be better people.
