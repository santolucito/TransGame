\section{Description of the status and stage of the organization/venture}
%(250 words maximum, please include all relevant milestones)    

\subsection{Progress}
In prior work~\cite{hwang2016}, we built an online game to change the information seeking behavior of patients' food purchasing decisions.
We ran a study to test the effectiveness of the game and noted statistically significant changes in behavior post-treatment.

To validate our technical capacity for mobile games, we built an android game for to help families switch pronouns more quickly. The .apk is available at \url{marksantolucito.com/trans.apk}. 


\subsection{Priorities}


Milestones: (Average Case)[Best Case][Worst Case]

- Build the game. (2 months)[2 months][3 months]
consider DONE if:
    - Tested game for basic function
    - Positive user tested the game with 5 users
    - Graphic Design

- Test the game for clinical effect. (2 months)[2 weeks][3 months]
consider DONE if:
    - initial usage (sign up)
    - sustainability ((in)consistent logged usage for both ends)
    - how often do you talk to your family
        -> can be measured through...
        -> gut feeling expect
         0 per wk => 2-3per wk.
         1 per wk => 2-3per wk.
    - self reports
    - push notifications
    
- Distribute the game.
-- Build network of providers
-- Build network of support groups (PFLAG)


Moving forward, our goals are illustrated in \autoref{fig:flowchart}.

% games are customizable (individualized treatment) - games will be dynamic because if the patient needs to spend more time on something then the games will be played longer and in this way the games will change depending on the need
