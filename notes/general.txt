# Some Unstructured Notes

# CBT (Cognitive behavioral therapy)

Framework for therapy, and already has some basis for electronic / remote delivery (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_behavioral_therapy#Computerized_or_internet-delivered). 

Meeting from YEI with Rick Hunt
 - Focus on emotional message
 - can this be applied outside a clinical context? maybe mention chocolate-covered broccoli
 - Highlight the technical capabilities of the team. no extra people needed (at least for V1)

Meeting from IHY with Cass Walker
 - See a prototype
 - Testing with real people
 - Great to be personally invested
 - go to more events at yale
